# MariaDB Workshop
Ricky's Totally Cool MariaDB Workshop. Let's get comfy with MariaDB.

**DISCLAIMER**
Although I work for MariaDB, all thoughts oppinions and topics discussed are my own.
My word is far from final.

I am merely speaking from experience, having fun, and sharing the love with the various tech communities I have been a part of for around 20 years to date.
